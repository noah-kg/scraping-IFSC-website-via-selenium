# Using Selenium to Scrape IFSC Website for World Cup Results

The International Federation of Sport Climbing ([IFSC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Federation_of_Sport_Climbing)) was founded in January of 2007 with the goal of being an international governing body for the sport of competition climbing, which consists of the disciplines [lead climbing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead_climbing), [bouldering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bouldering), and [speed climbing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_climbing).
I really love climbing, so I figured a project involving climbing would be great for me. I also think web-scraping is insanely useful and really fascinating - though I still have a lot to learn about it.

## Project Goals
* Learn how to use [Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/) to both scrape the [Internation Federation of Sport Climbing](https://www.ifsc-climbing.org/) website as well as navigate it
* Exploratory Data Analysis
* Improve/practice my Python programming
